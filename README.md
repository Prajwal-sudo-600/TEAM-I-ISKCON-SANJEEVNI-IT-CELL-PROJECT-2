# 📅 Sanjevani IT Cell – Room & Resource Allocation System

## 📖 Background & Purpose
The **Sanjevani IT Cell** conducts regular activities such as meetings, training sessions, and workshops. Currently, managing these requires manual coordination via messages/spreadsheets, leading to double bookings and confusion.

This project is a **Room and Resource Allocation System** designed to streamline this process. It allows Admins to manage assets and schedules, while Users (organizers/volunteers) can request bookings digitally. It features a light **AI integration** to suggest alternative slots when conflicts occur.
